        Acton Film Club is a membership screening club founded in August 2009 by
        Mark Mason and Nick Jones. Screening every three weeks in West London,
        the club covers a wide range of cinema — silent films, world cinema,
        contemporary releases, classic British and American pictures, and cult
        movies — with Nick Jones introducing each film and occasional
        member-selected evenings thrown in.
