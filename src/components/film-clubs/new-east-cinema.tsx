        New East Cinema is a curatorial collective founded in 2014, dedicated to
        auteur-driven cinema from Eastern Europe, Russia, the Balkans, and
        Central Asia. Operating as an alternative distribution platform, the
        collective brings some of the most vital and underscreened films from
        the region to UK audiences — regularly partnering with the Barbican and
        publishing a bi-monthly newsletter of news, recommendations, and
        opportunities from across the New East.
