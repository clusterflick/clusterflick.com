        New East Cinema is a London screening club dedicated to films from
        Eastern Europe, Central Asia, Russia, and the wider post-Soviet world.
        Championing contemporary directors alongside the great masters of Soviet
        and Eastern European cinema, New East Cinema opens a window onto some of
        the most vital and underscreened national cinemas of our time.
