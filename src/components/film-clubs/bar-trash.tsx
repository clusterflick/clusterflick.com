        Bar Trash is London&apos;s home for cult, trash, and midnight movie
        screenings. Taking over bars and unconventional spaces across the city,
        Bar Trash creates rowdy, irreverent cinema nights built around the
        gloriously bad, the gloriously weird, and the gloriously underappreciated
        — films best enjoyed with a drink in hand and a crowd who&apos;s in on
        the joke.
