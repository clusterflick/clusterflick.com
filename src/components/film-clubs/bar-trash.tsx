        Bar Trash is a weekly film night celebrating overlooked, cult, and
        glorious B-movies — the films mainstream cinema left behind. Running
        since 2022 under the Token Homo umbrella, Bar Trash curates thematic
        seasons exploring everything from synthetic flesh to banned films to
        vintage VHS discoveries, all served with themed drinks and prize
        giveaways. Starting at Genesis Cinema and now touring venues across
        North London, Time Out named it one of the city&apos;s essential
        affordable nights out.
