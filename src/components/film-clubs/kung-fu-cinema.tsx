        Kung Fu Cinema is the creation of Marlon Palmer, exhibitor and
        distributor of Black cinema for over twenty years and a lifelong kung fu
        devotee. Reviving the spirit of London&apos;s legendary late-night
        martial arts picture houses of the 1980s, the bimonthly club screens
        Hong Kong classics at Genesis Cinema, Ritzy Brixton, and beyond —
        kicking off with arcade games, hip-hop beats, and bar drinks before a
        raucous 10pm screening. Also known as Drunken Scorpion Presents.
