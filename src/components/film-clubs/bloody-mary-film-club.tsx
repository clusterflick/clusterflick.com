        Bloody Mary Film Club combines cult cinema with cocktail culture for a
        gloriously indulgent night out. Named after the classic drink, the club
        brings together horror, exploitation, and genre film with a party
        atmosphere — the kind of screenings best enjoyed with a Bloody Mary in
        hand and a crowd who&apos;s there for the ride.
