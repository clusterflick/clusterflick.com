        Bloody Mary Film Club presents cult films to die for — horror,
        exploitation, and genre cinema with a devoted London following. The club
        pairs screenings with introductions that dig into the films&apos;
        history, cultural context, and transgressive pleasures, drawing on
        academic as well as fan perspectives. Past events at Genesis Cinema have
        included cult screenings with guest introductions exploring violent
        women on screen and fantasies of vengeance.
