        Richmond Film Society has been bringing world cinema to South West
        London since 2 April 1963, when it screened its first film — Grigoriy
        Chukhray&apos;s <em>Ballad of a Soldier</em> — at the Richmond Community
        Centre. Now a registered charity screening on alternate Tuesday evenings
        at The Exchange in Twickenham, the Society has shown nearly 900 films
        across more than sixty seasons, with no ads and no trailers, to an
        audience of over 5,000 per year.
