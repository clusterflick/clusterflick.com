        Distorted Frame is a film club dedicated to digital cinema — screening
        beautiful, original films that could only have been made with digital
        technology. Based at The Castle Cinema in Clapton, the club champions
        the possibilities of the format, from intimate arthouse works to genre
        films that push digital imagery into unexpected places. Distorted Frame
        frequently collaborates with other London screening collectives,
        including Violet Hour.
