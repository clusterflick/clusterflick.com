        Violet Hour is a film club dedicated to the dark, transgressive, and
        enigmatic side of the screen — screening works that unsettle, challenge,
        and explore the stranger corners of human experience. Thematic
        programmes have included paranormal horror and surveillance cinema,
        often in collaboration with fellow collectives such as Distorted Frame.
