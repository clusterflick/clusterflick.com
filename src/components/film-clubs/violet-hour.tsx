        Violet Hour is a late-night cinema club for night owls and lovers of
        after-dark cinema. Taking its name from the liminal hour between
        afternoon and evening, Violet Hour programmes films that suit the night
        — atmospheric, sensual, uncanny, or simply best appreciated when the
        world has quietened down.
