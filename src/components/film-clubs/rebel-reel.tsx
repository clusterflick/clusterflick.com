        Rebel Reel Cine Club is a pop-up cinema founded by Chris McGill,
        screening timeless classics and cutting-edge films — many from
        counterculture or that challenge mainstream sensibilities. Events are
        held at venues including the Rio Cinema in Dalston, the 100 Club on
        Oxford Street, and outdoor locations in Kent. Chris makes a unique
        handmade badge for every screening, and regulars travel miles to events
        they otherwise might have missed.
