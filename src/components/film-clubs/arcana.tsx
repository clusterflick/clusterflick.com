        Arcana is London&apos;s sapphic movie club — a cinema night dedicated
        to queer women&apos;s stories and sapphic perspectives on screen. Each
        event brings together an audience of dykes, lesbians, bisexuals, and
        queer women to watch films that speak to their experiences, from
        underground rarities to mainstream releases reappraised through a
        sapphic lens.
