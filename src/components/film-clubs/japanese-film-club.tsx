        Japanese Film Club is dedicated to the rich and varied tradition of
        Japanese cinema. From the golden age of Kurosawa and Ozu to the
        contemporary masters of J-horror, anime, and beyond, the club brings
        a wide range of Japanese films to London screens — celebrating one of
        the most influential national cinemas in the world.
