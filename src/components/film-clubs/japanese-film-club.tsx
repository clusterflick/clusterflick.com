        Japanese Film Club brings audiences together to watch Japanese cinema on
        the big screen at the Rio Cinema in Dalston. Founded in 2025 by Will —
        who spent eight years living in Japan and runs the documentary
        distribution company MadeGood — the club spans classic and contemporary
        Japanese film. Both inaugural screenings, of <em>Tampopo</em> and the
        documentary <em>Gaea Girls</em>, sold out immediately.
