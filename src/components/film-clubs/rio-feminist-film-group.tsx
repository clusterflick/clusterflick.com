        Rio Feminist Film Group revives and continues a long tradition of
        feminist film programming at the Rio Cinema in Dalston. Founded by Sarah
        Chorley, Helen de Witt, Selina Robertson, and Corinna Antrobus, the
        group was inspired by the Rio&apos;s feminist cinema history of the late
        1970s and 1980s — including the Women&apos;s Media Resource Project,
        which ran from 1983. Screenings centring women&apos;s stories and
        challenging patriarchal narratives are paired with post-film discussion.
