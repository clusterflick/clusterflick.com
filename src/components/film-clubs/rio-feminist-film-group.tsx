        Rio Feminist Film Group runs feminist film screenings and discussions at
        the Rio Cinema in Hackney. Programming films that centre women&apos;s
        stories, challenge patriarchal narratives, and explore feminist
        filmmaking across history and cultures, the group pairs each screening
        with lively post-film conversation — making it as much a discussion
        space as a cinema night.
