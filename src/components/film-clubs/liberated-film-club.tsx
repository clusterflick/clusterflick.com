        Liberated Film Club is a politically engaged cinema club committed to
        radical, challenging, and thought-provoking film. Drawing on a tradition
        of activist and documentary cinema, the club screens films that question
        power, illuminate injustice, and imagine different worlds — always
        accompanied by discussion and debate.
