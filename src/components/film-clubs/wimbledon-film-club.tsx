        Wimbledon Film Club is a registered charity and community cinema club
        celebrating its twentieth year of screenings. Run entirely by
        volunteers, the club screens world cinema, British films, and
        independent features on selected Tuesday evenings from September to June
        — most recently at the Odeon Wimbledon. Since 2008 it has run a
        dedicated Black History Month programme, and over twenty seasons it has
        amassed nearly 400 screenings spanning languages, decades, and
        continents.
