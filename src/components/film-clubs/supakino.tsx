        Ruprai, built around fun and unusual thematic screenings. Programmes
        include <em>Turbans Seen On Screen</em>, exploring Sikh representation
        in cinema; <em>Bombay Mix</em>, a series of South Asian film
        double-bills; and <em>Midnight Excess</em>, a late-night programme of
        weird and wonderful films at the Rio Cinema. Events often feature live
        music, short films, and renowned guest speakers.
