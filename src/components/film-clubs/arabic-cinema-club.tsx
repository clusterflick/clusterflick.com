        The Arab Film Club is a community of film lovers and podcast dedicated
        to exploring and celebrating cinema from across the Arab world. Founded
        and curated by Sarah Agha, the club presents screenings of films written
        and directed by Arab filmmakers — from Egyptian classics to contemporary
        voices from Lebanon, Palestine, North Africa, and beyond. Events have
        sold out at the Southbank Centre, the Garden Cinema, and the Prince
        Charles Cinema, accompanied by an active podcast series.
