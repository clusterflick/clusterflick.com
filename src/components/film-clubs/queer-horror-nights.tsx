        Queer Horror Nights is a London screening club dedicated to horror
        through a queer lens — celebrating the fear, the camp, the subversion,
        and the unexpected joy of LGBTQ+ horror cinema. From queer readings of
        genre classics to contemporary films that centre queer characters and
        stories, Queer Horror Nights creates a community for people who find
        something deeply personal in the dark.
