        Queer Horror Nights is an 18+ horror screening series run by Token Homo
        and Last Frame Club, celebrating horror through a queer lens — the fear,
        the camp, the subversion, and the transgressive joy of the genre.
        Costume, kink, and fetish-friendly, the nights have featured live shadow
        casts, drag performances, and annual Halloween Monsters Balls at the Rio
        Cinema. Past screenings include <em>Frankenstein</em>, <em>Carrie</em>,{" "}
        <em>Nightbreed</em>, and <em>The Rocky Horror Picture Show</em>.
