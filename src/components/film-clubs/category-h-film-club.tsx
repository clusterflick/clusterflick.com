        Category H Film Club is a horror double bill night at Rio Cinema in
        Dalston, run by Molly Miles and Scary Claire. Taking its name from a
        vintage UK film classification, the club specialises in wildly themed
        late-night pairings — past programmes have revolved around topics as
        specific as worms, computers, and necrophilia — in a friendly, welcoming
        environment for horror newcomers and devotees alike.
