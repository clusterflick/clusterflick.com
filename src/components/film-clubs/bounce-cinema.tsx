        Bounce Cinema champions emerging filmmakers alongside curated film
        screenings. Collaborating with venues including Curzon, Everyman, Rich
        Mix, and The Hoxton, Bounce combines screening events with educational
        programming through its Bounce Film School and runs dedicated screenings
        for under-25s. More than a film club, it is a creative ecosystem for
        independent talent — accepting film submissions and offering direct
        pathways to audiences.
