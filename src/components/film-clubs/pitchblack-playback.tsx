        Pitchblack Playback is an immersive listening experience created by
        London DJ and producer Ben Gomori in 2006. Audiences sit in cinema
        seats, pull on an eye mask as the lights go out, and hear classic
        albums, pre-release premieres, and bespoke mixes on powerful cinema
        sound systems — in complete darkness. Artists featured have included
        Radiohead, Nick Cave, Floating Points, and Tame Impala. Sessions have
        appeared at the BFI London Film Festival alongside complementary film
        screenings.
