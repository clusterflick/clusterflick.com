        The Gothique Film Society is London&apos;s only specialist horror and
        fantasy film club — and one of the longest running in the world, founded
        in September 1966. Presenting double bills for the connoisseur of the
        macabre, the Society specialises in obscure and rarely seen horror and
        fantasy films from the 1930s to the 1970s. Its illustrious history
        includes honorary presidents Christopher Lee and Hammer director Terence
        Fisher. Today it screens at the Cinema Museum in Kennington, running
        from October to March each season.
