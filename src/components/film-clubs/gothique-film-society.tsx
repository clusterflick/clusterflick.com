        Gothique Film Society celebrates gothic, horror, and dark fantasy cinema
        in all its forms. From the atmospheric dread of German Expressionism to
        the lush excess of Hammer Horror and the psychological complexities of
        contemporary arthouse horror, Gothique creates a devoted space for
        lovers of the macabre and the mysterious.
