        Electric Cinema Portobello is one of London&apos;s oldest and most
        iconic cinemas, located on Portobello Road in Notting Hill, west London.
        Originally opened in 1910, it is one of the earliest purpose-built
        cinemas in Britain. Now part of the Electric Cinema group and owned by
        Soho House, the venue has been beautifully restored and features luxury
        leather armchairs, double beds in the front rows, and a bar serving food
        and drinks to your seat.

        and arthouse films. With its rich history and plush, intimate
        surroundings, Electric Cinema Portobello offers one of London&apos;s
        most distinctive and luxurious cinema-going experiences.
