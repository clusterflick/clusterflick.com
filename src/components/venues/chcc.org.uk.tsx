        Chadwell Heath Community Centre hosts film screenings through Curated
        Community Cinema, a community-focused initiative that brings independent
        and international films to local audiences. The venue has served as a
        screening location for events like the Picture East Film Festival
        (PEFF), showcasing documentaries and feature films with Q&As and
        filmmaker discussions that connect audiences with the stories and
        creators behind the work. As a multi-purpose community space in Romford,
        the centre transforms into a cinema for special events, offering an
        accessible and welcoming environment for film lovers in East London to
        experience cinema beyond mainstream multiplexes.
