        The Science Museum is a major national museum on Exhibition Road in
        South Kensington, central London. The museum houses an IMAX cinema—one
        of the largest screens in London—which shows a programme of IMAX
        documentary films alongside blockbuster releases in the immersive
        large-format. The museum also occasionally hosts special film screenings
        and events as part of its wider public programme.
