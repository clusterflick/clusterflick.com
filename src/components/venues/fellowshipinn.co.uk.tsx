        The Fellowship Inn is a historic Grade II listed pub on Randlesdown Road
        in Bellingham, Southeast London. Originally built in 1924 as part of the
        Bellingham Estate—one of London&apos;s largest interwar housing
        developments—it was restored with Heritage Lottery funding and reopened
        as a community hub. The venue now houses The Fellowship Cinema alongside
        a bar, cafe, and event spaces, screening a mix of mainstream,
        independent, and classic films for the local community.
