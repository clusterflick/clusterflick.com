        Metro Cinema is an independent cinema on Station Road in Harrow,
        northwest London. The venue screens a programme of mainstream new
        releases alongside Bollywood and South Asian films, reflecting the
        diverse local community. As an independently operated cinema, it
        provides an affordable local alternative to the larger multiplex chains
        in the Harrow area.
