        The programme blends independent, foreign-language, and documentary
        films with selected mainstream releases, alongside special screenings,
        Q&amp;A events, and community-focused programming such as parent and
        baby screenings and kids&apos; clubs. Its location in the heart of
        Hackney places it in one of London&apos;s most culturally vibrant
        neighbourhoods.
