        Everyman at The Whiteley is part of the Everyman cinema group, a
        boutique chain known for its intimate, living-room-style cinema
        experience. Located on Porchester Gardens in Bayswater, west London,
        within the beautifully restored Whiteleys department store building, the
        venue offers sofa-style seating, food and drink served directly to your
        seat, and a curated programme of mainstream releases alongside
        independent and arthouse films. The cinema also features a bar area for
        pre- and post-film drinks.

        Like all Everyman venues, it offers a membership scheme for regular
        cinema-goers and a focus on quality over quantity, with smaller,
        carefully designed screening rooms that prioritise comfort and
        atmosphere. Its setting within the landmark Whiteley building—a Grade II
        listed former department store transformed into a mixed-use
        destination—adds a touch of grandeur to the cinema-going experience.
