        The Strand Building is part of King&apos;s College London&apos;s Strand
        Campus in Central London, one of the university&apos;s main sites. While
        primarily an academic building, the campus hosts occasional public film
        screenings and cultural events, often organised by student societies
        such as the KCL Film Society or as part of public engagement programmes
        and academic conferences.
