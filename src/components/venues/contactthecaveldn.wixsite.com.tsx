        The Cave is a community-focused creative hub and co-working space in
        Hackney Wick, East London. Home to a collective of in-house artists,
        performers, musicians, and filmmakers, the space hosts film screenings
        alongside its broader programme of creative events and courses. With
        studio hire, a resident café (THINK Cafe), and a rotating roster of
        community-driven programming, The Cave brings together local creatives
        and audiences in an accessible, independent setting.
