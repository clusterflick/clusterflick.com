        Boxpark Wembley is a street food and events venue on Olympic Way in
        Wembley, northwest London, part of the Boxpark group of pop-up mall
        concepts built from repurposed shipping containers. Primarily known as a
        food hall, bar, and live events space—particularly busy on match days at
        nearby Wembley Stadium—Boxpark Wembley also occasionally hosts outdoor
        and indoor film screenings as part of its events programme.
