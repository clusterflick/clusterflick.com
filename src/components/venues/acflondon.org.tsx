        The Austrian Cultural Forum London is a cultural institute that
        champions Austrian cinema alongside music, visual arts, and literature.
        Film screenings here lean towards contemporary Austrian cinema,
        documentaries, and experimental works, often accompanied by Q&As with
        directors and filmmakers. The venue hosts curated film series like
        &quot;Court Life&quot; and &quot;CineClub,&quot; as well as one-off
        screenings that spotlight emerging Austrian talent and socially engaged
        filmmaking, making it an essential stop for anyone interested in
        what&apos;s happening in Austrian film today.

        The Forum is also behind watchAUT, an annual festival (held in
        partnership with other venues like the ICA and Ciné Lumière) that
        showcases the best new Austrian films, many of which haven&apos;t had UK
        theatrical releases. Located in Knightsbridge, the venue itself is an
        intimate space that fosters dialogue between filmmakers and audiences,
        with screenings often part of wider cultural events. It&apos;s less
        about mainstream fare and more about discovering bold, thought-provoking
        cinema from Austria&apos;s thriving independent scene.
