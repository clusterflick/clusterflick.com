        Everyman Baker Street is part of the Everyman cinema group, a boutique
        chain known for its intimate, living-room-style cinema experience.
        Located on Baker Street in Marylebone, central London, the venue offers
        the signature Everyman experience: sofa-style seating, food and drink
        served directly to your seat, and a curated programme of mainstream
        releases alongside independent and arthouse films. The cinema also
        features a stylish bar area for pre- and post-film drinks.

        Like all Everyman venues, it offers a membership scheme for regular
        cinema-goers and a focus on quality over quantity, with smaller,
        carefully designed screening rooms that prioritise comfort and
        atmosphere.
