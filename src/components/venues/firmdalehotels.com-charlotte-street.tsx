        The Charlotte Street Hotel is a luxury boutique hotel on Charlotte
        Street in Fitzrovia, central London, part of the Firmdale Hotels group
        founded by Tim and Kit Kemp. The hotel houses a private screening room
        that is used for the Firmdale Film Club, a regular programme of film
        screenings open to hotel guests and members. The intimate, plushly
        designed cinema seats a small audience in comfortable surroundings,
        reflecting Firmdale&apos;s signature style of bold, colourful interiors.

        The Firmdale Film Club programme typically features a curated mix of new
        releases, classics, and special screenings, often accompanied by supper
        or drinks. It&apos;s a distinctive, upscale alternative to a
        conventional cinema visit, combining film with the hospitality and
        design flair that Firmdale Hotels are known for.
