        The Beehive Pub in Tottenham hosts Film Tottenham, a community cinema
        and filmmaking hub that runs regular screenings in the pub&apos;s
        function room. Using a projector screen and sound-mixed system, Film
        Tottenham presents a mix of independent short films, feature films, and
        curated themed seasons, often with live performances, post-screening
        discussions, and Q&As with filmmakers. The venue has hosted over 25
        screenings and runs the annual Tottenham Film Festival, showcasing short
        films across drama, comedy, thriller, horror, animation, and
        international categories, creating a grassroots platform for emerging
        filmmakers.

        Supported by Film Hub London and the BFI Film Audience Network, Film
        Tottenham programmes everything from classic cinema (like Brief
        Encounter and Romeo and Juliet) to contemporary indies and
        documentaries, with many screenings tied to wider cultural themes or
        community initiatives like Haringey&apos;s Black History 365 programme.
        All screenings are for ages 18+ and take place in the cosy pub setting,
        making it a welcoming, informal space where film lovers and filmmakers
        can connect over cinema in a true community atmosphere.
