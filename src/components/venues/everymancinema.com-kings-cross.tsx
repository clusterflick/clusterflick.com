        Everyman King&apos;s Cross, also known as Everyman On The Corner, is
        part of the Everyman cinema group, a boutique chain known for its
        intimate, living-room-style cinema experience. Located on Handyside
        Street in the redeveloped King&apos;s Cross quarter, the venue offers
        sofa-style seating, food and drink served directly to your seat, and a
        curated programme of mainstream releases alongside independent and
        arthouse films. The cinema also features a bar area for pre- and
        post-film drinks.

        Like all Everyman venues, it offers a membership scheme for regular
        cinema-goers and a focus on quality over quantity, with smaller,
        carefully designed screening rooms that prioritise comfort and
        atmosphere. Its location in the vibrant Coal Drops Yard area, surrounded
        by restaurants, shops, and the Regent&apos;s Canal, makes it well placed
        for a wider day or evening out.
