        Genesis Cinema is an independent cinema on Mile End Road in Whitechapel,
        east London. One of the oldest surviving cinema buildings in the East
        End, it has been screening films since 1999 under its current guise,
        following a long history as a cinema and theatre dating back to 1912.
        The venue features multiple screens and offers a programme blending
        mainstream new releases with independent, arthouse, Bollywood, and world
        cinema, reflecting the diversity of its surrounding neighbourhood.
