        Birkbeck, University of London hosts film screenings through the
        Birkbeck Institute for the Moving Image (BIMI), a research centre that
        combines academic film scholarship with public film curation. BIMI
        programmes curated screenings, retrospectives, and film seasons at
        venues including the Gordon Square Cinema (43 Gordon Square), often
        featuring rare prints, international cinema, and experimental works
        alongside post-screening discussions with filmmakers, scholars, and
        critics. Past programming has included events like The Essay Film
        Festival and themed seasons exploring specific directors, movements, or
        national cinemas.

        Beyond BIMI&apos;s academic programming, Birkbeck Film Society (run by
        students) hosts regular screenings in university lecture halls,
        showcasing everything from classic cinema to contemporary arthouse and
        anime. These student-led events are more informal and often themed
        around seasons or special occasions. With its Bloomsbury location and
        evening-focused schedule (Birkbeck specializes in part-time evening
        study), the university&apos;s film events attract a mix of students,
        academics, and film enthusiasts looking for intellectually engaged
        cinema experiences that go beyond commercial programming.
