        ActOne Cinema is a community-driven independent cinema housed in the
        beautifully restored Passmore Edwards Old Library on Acton High Street.
        With two intimate 60-seat screening rooms, it programmes a diverse mix
        of independent, arthouse, and crossover films alongside event cinema and
        festival screenings. The venue was brought to life by local residents
        and over 100 volunteers who campaigned to return the historic building
        to community use, and that grassroots spirit still defines everything
        ActOne does today.

        Beyond its carefully curated film programme, ActOne is a true cultural
        hub with weekly parent and baby screenings, Saturday morning
        children&apos;s films, and regular relaxed screenings for neurodiverse
        audiences. The cinema also hosts live events, open mic nights, and
        collaborations with local groups, making it as much a social space as a
        screening venue. With a welcoming café and lounge area, ActOne
        transforms a trip to the cinema into a genuine community experience
        where film lovers of all ages can gather and connect.
