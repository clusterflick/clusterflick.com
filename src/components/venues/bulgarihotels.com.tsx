        While The Private Cinema operates mainly as a private hire and
        members&apos; venue rather than offering public film listings, it
        represents the ultimate boutique screening experience—combining
        Bulgari&apos;s connection to the silver screen with state-of-the-art
        technology and luxurious hospitality. The space can accommodate intimate
        personal screenings for hotel guests or larger events for up to 47
        attendees, with dedicated audio-visual support ensuring a flawless
        cinematic experience in one of London&apos;s most exclusive settings.
