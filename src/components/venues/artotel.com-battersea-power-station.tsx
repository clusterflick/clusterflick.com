        JOIA is a rooftop restaurant and bar on the 15th floor of art&apos;otel
        at Battersea Power Station that hosts pop-up outdoor film screenings as
        part of its events programme. These special screenings typically take
        place on the rooftop terrace overlooking the iconic chimneys, combining
        dinner at the Iberian restaurant with classic films shown under the
        stars. Blankets, hot water bottles, and popcorn create a cosy cinema
        experience outdoors, with events often themed around occasions like
        Valentine&apos;s Day featuring romantic classics. It&apos;s an elevated
        take on dinner-and-a-movie rather than a dedicated cinema, offering
        occasional screenings as part of the venue&apos;s broader cultural and
        dining programme.
