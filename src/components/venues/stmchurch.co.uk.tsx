        St Matthias Church is a Grade I-listed Anglican church on Wordsworth
        Road in Stoke Newington, the only church in the area with that
        designation. The Victorian building seats up to 250 with flexible
        seating and excellent acoustics, and the adjoining St Matthias Hall
        offers a more intimate space for up to 100. The church has also served
        as a filming location, notably for the opening episode of Killing Eve
        series 4.
