        Everyman Borough Yards is part of the Everyman cinema group, a boutique
        chain known for its intimate, living-room-style cinema experience.
        Located in the Borough Yards development near Borough Market and London
        Bridge, the venue offers sofa-style seating, food and drink served
        directly to your seat, and a curated programme of mainstream releases
        alongside independent and arthouse films. The cinema also features a bar
        area for pre- and post-film drinks.

        Like all Everyman venues, it offers a membership scheme for regular
        cinema-goers and a focus on quality over quantity, with smaller,
        carefully designed screening rooms that prioritise comfort and
        atmosphere. Its location in the heart of Southwark&apos;s food and
        culture district makes it easy to pair a film with a wider evening out.
