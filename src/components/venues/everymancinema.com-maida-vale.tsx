        Everyman Maida Vale is part of the Everyman cinema group, a boutique
        chain known for its intimate, living-room-style cinema experience.
        Located on Sutherland Avenue in the residential neighbourhood of Maida
        Vale, West London, the venue offers sofa-style seating, food and drink
        served directly to your seat, and a curated programme of mainstream
        releases alongside independent and arthouse films. The cinema also
        features a bar area for pre- and post-film drinks.
      </p>

        Like all Everyman venues, it offers a membership scheme for regular
        cinema-goers and a focus on quality over quantity, with smaller,
        carefully designed screening rooms that prioritise comfort and
        atmosphere.
