        Birkbeck Cinema is the screening venue for the Birkbeck Institute for
        the Moving Image (BIMI), a research centre that combines academic film
        scholarship with public film curation. Located at 43 Gordon Square in
        Bloomsbury, the cinema hosts curated screenings, retrospectives, and
        film seasons, often featuring rare prints, international cinema, and
        experimental works alongside post-screening discussions with filmmakers,
        scholars, and critics.
