        Beer Merchants Tap in Hackney Wick hosts BAR TRASH, a regular cult
        cinema night run by Token Homo that brings queer, cult, and curious
        cinema to the pub&apos;s upstairs screening space. Events feature
        everything from blaxploitation classics and horror films to banned Video
        Nasties and cult favourites, all presented with themed drinks,
        introductions, intermissions, prize giveaways, and subtitles. The
        atmosphere is relaxed and social—audiences are encouraged to laugh,
        whoop, and treat it like a fun night out rather than a reverential
        cinema experience.

        Screenings take place in an informal pub setting with a projector and
        sound system, creating an intimate and interactive vibe where film fans
        can enjoy a pint alongside the movie. With events strictly for ages 18+,
        BAR TRASH combines craft beer culture with adventurous film programming,
        making Beer Merchants Tap a unique spot for discovering offbeat cinema
        in a laid-back, community-focused environment.
