        Regent Street Cinema is a historic cinema at 307 Regent Street in the
        heart of London&apos;s West End, housed within the University of
        Westminster. The venue holds a remarkable place in cinema history: it
        was here in 1896 that the Lumière brothers gave the first public
        screening of films in the UK. After decades of use as a university
        lecture theatre, the cinema was beautifully restored and reopened to the
        public in 2015.

        Today, Regent Street Cinema programmes a curated mix of independent,
        arthouse, classic, and world cinema alongside selected new releases,
        special seasons, and Q&amp;A events. Its restored Edwardian interior and
        pioneering heritage make it one of London&apos;s most historically
        significant and atmospheric places to watch a film.
