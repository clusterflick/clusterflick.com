        Ciné Lumière is the cinema at the Institut français du Royaume-Uni,
        located on Queensberry Place in South Kensington. It is one of
        London&apos;s premier venues for French and francophone cinema,
        screening a rich programme of classic, contemporary, and arthouse
        French-language films, often with English subtitles. The cinema also
        shows a broader range of international and world cinema alongside themed
        seasons, film festivals, and special events.

        With its dedicated screening room and close ties to French cultural
        life, Ciné Lumière is a unique fixture in London&apos;s cinema
        landscape, offering audiences access to films that are rarely shown
        elsewhere in the city.
