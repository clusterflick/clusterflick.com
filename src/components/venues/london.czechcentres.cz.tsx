        The Czech Centre London is the cultural arm of the Czech Embassy,
        located at 30 Kensington Palace Gardens in West London. It promotes
        Czech arts and culture in the UK through a programme of events including
        film screenings, exhibitions, concerts, and talks. Its cinema programme
        features Czech and Central European films—both classic and
        contemporary—often with English subtitles, providing a rare opportunity
        to see Czech cinema on the big screen in London.
