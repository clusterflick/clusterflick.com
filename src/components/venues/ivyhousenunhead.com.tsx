        The Ivy House is a Grade II listed community-owned pub on Stuart Road in
        Nunhead, south London. It was the first pub in the UK to be listed as an
        Asset of Community Value and was saved from redevelopment by local
        residents, who now run it as a co-operative. Alongside its regular pub
        operation and live music programme, the Ivy House hosts occasional film
        screenings and cinema events as part of its community activities.
