        Close-Up Film Centre is an independent cinema and film resource on
        Sclater Street in Shoreditch, East London. Founded as a not-for-profit
        cultural space dedicated to adventurous and experimental cinema, it
        programmes a distinctive mix of arthouse, avant-garde, documentary, and
        world cinema that sits well outside the mainstream. The intimate
        screening room also serves as a space for film talks, workshops, and
        educational events.

        Close-Up is also home to a lending library of DVDs and books on film,
        making it a unique resource for cinephiles and filmmakers. Its
        programming ethos prioritises discovery, with a focus on rare, classic,
        and underseen films that are seldom shown elsewhere in London.
