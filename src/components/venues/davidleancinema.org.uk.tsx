        The David Lean Cinema is a volunteer-run community cinema housed within
        the Croydon Clocktower arts complex on Katharine Street in Croydon,
        south London. Named after the legendary British film director David
        Lean—who was born in nearby Croydon—the cinema screens a thoughtfully
        curated programme of independent, arthouse, classic, and world cinema,
        alongside selected mainstream releases. The venue is a registered
        charity and is operated entirely by dedicated volunteers.

        With its single screen and community-focused ethos, the David Lean
        Cinema offers an intimate, affordable alternative to the larger
        multiplex chains in the Croydon area.
