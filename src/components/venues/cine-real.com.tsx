        Ciné-Real is the UK&apos;s only film club dedicated exclusively to
        screening films on 16mm, founded in 2011 by Oscar-longlisted director
        Liam Saint-Pierre and projectionist Ümit Mesut of the legendary Ümit &
        Son film emporium in Clapton. The pair search the planet for rare 16mm
        prints, bringing audiences everything from classic Hollywood
        (Casablanca, When Harry Met Sally) to arthouse gems (Alphaville), all
        projected on original celluloid with the projector visible in the cinema
        so audiences can experience the magic of analogue film firsthand. With
        intermissions for reel changes and Ümit&apos;s famous on-the-spot
        repairs (timed by the audience), each screening is a unique,
        unpredictable event.

        Now in permanent residency at The Castle Cinema in Homerton, Ciné-Real
        has been selling out monthly screenings for years, building a passionate
        community of film lovers and filmmakers united by their appreciation for
        the warmth and colour reproduction that only 16mm can deliver. Before
        each screening, Liam and Ümit introduce the film and share insights,
        creating an intimate, conversational atmosphere that feels like stepping
        into Cinema Paradiso. There&apos;s even a raffle at the end with prizes
        like Ciné-Real tote bags and super 8mm prints. It&apos;s not resistance
        against digital—just an elegant case for why celluloid and digital
        should coexist.
