        The Ritzy Picturehouse is a much-loved local landmark and part of the
        Picturehouse cinema group, a chain of independent-minded cinemas known
        for combining quality arthouse and mainstream programming with stylish
        bar and cafe spaces. Located on Coldharbour Lane in Brixton, south
        London, the Ritzy originally opened in 1911 as the Electric Pavilion and
        is one of the oldest surviving cinemas in the country. The venue
        features multiple screens, a bar, and a cafe area. Picturehouse cinemas
        offer a membership scheme that provides discounts and priority booking
        across the chain.
