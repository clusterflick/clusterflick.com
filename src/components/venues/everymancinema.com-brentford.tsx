        Everyman Brentford is part of the Everyman cinema group, a boutique
        chain known for its intimate, living-room-style cinema experience.
        Located on West Bradbury Yard in Brentford, west London, the venue
        offers sofa-style seating, food and drink served directly to your seat,
        and a curated programme of mainstream releases alongside independent and
        arthouse films. The cinema also features a bar area for pre- and
        post-film drinks.

        Like all Everyman venues, it offers a membership scheme for regular
        cinema-goers and a focus on quality over quantity, with smaller,
        carefully designed screening rooms that prioritise comfort and
        atmosphere.
