        Croydon Sports Arena is a sports and leisure facility that occasionally
        hosts one-off film screenings and community cinema events in its
        multi-purpose spaces. These special screenings tend to focus on
        documentaries, community interest films, and themed events that bring
        people together around particular topics or causes. While the venue is
        primarily known for its football pitches and athletics facilities, the
        flexibility of its indoor spaces allows it to transform into a screening
        venue for events that serve the local Croydon community, offering an
        alternative cinema experience outside traditional theatre settings.
