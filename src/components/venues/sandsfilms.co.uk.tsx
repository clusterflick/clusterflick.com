        Sands Films Cinema is an independent cinema and film studio on St
        Marychurch Street in Rotherhithe, Southeast London. Originally
        established as a film production studio—specialising in period costume
        drama—Sands Films expanded to include a small cinema screening room that
        hosts a regular programme of independent, classic, documentary, and
        world cinema. The venue has a strong community focus and a distinctive,
        intimate atmosphere.
