        The Clapham Grand is a Grade II listed concert hall and entertainment
        venue on St John&apos;s Hill in Clapham, south London. Originally built
        in 1900 as a music hall, it has served variously as a theatre, cinema,
        bingo hall, and nightclub over the decades. Today it operates as a
        multi-purpose live events space hosting concerts, comedy nights, club
        nights, and—alongside its main programme—occasional film screenings and
        cinema events in its atmospheric Victorian auditorium.
