        Electric Cinema White City is part of the Electric Cinema group, owned
        by Soho House. Located within the former BBC Television Centre on Wood
        Lane in White City, West London, this modern venue offers the same
        luxury experience as its historic Portobello sibling: leather armchairs,
        cashmere blankets, and a bar serving food and drinks to your seat. The
        programme mixes mainstream new releases with independent, classic, and
        arthouse films.
