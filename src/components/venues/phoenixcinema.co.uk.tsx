        The Phoenix Cinema is one of the oldest continuously operating cinemas
        in the UK, located on the High Road in East Finchley, North London. The
        building dates back to 1910 and the cinema has been screening films on
        the site since 1912. Now run as a charitable trust, the Phoenix is a
        treasured single-screen independent cinema that programmes a carefully
        curated mix of mainstream, independent, arthouse, classic, and world
        cinema.

        events, Q&amp;A screenings, and themed seasons. Its Art Deco-influenced
        interior and rich history make it one of North London&apos;s most
        cherished cultural institutions.
