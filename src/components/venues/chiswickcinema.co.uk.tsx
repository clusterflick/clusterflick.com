        The Chiswick Cinema is a five-screen independent cinema that opened in
        2021, bringing cinema back to Chiswick High Road for the first time in
        almost 90 years. The venue programmes a broad mix of Hollywood releases,
        arthouse titles, and filmed performances from opera, theatre, and
        ballet, alongside curated seasons and strands including Andrea&apos;s
        Film Club, Knitflicks, Books on Film, and themed programming like
        Hitchcock for Halloween and Noirvember. The cinema is known for hosting
        Q&As with filmmakers and actors, creating opportunities for audiences to
        engage more deeply with the films they&apos;re watching.
