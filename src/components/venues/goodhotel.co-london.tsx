        Good Hotel London is a floating hotel moored at Royal Victoria Dock in
        East London. Operating as a social enterprise, the hotel reinvests its
        profits into training and employment programmes for local people.
        Alongside its accommodation and restaurant, the venue occasionally hosts
        film screenings and cultural events as part of its community-focused
        programme.
