        The Olympic Cinema is located on Church Road in Barnes, southwest
        London, within the historic Olympic Studios complex. The studios have a
        legendary history in music recording—artists from The Beatles and The
        Rolling Stones to Queen and Jimi Hendrix recorded here. Now operating as
        a boutique cinema and members&apos; club, the venue features beautifully
        designed screening rooms with comfortable seating, a bar, and a
