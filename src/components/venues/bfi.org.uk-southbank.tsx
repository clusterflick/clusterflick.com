        BFI Southbank is one of the world&apos;s leading year-round film venues,
        with four screens dedicated to showcasing the widest possible range of
        cinema. From newly restored classics and director retrospectives to
        international arthouse, experimental works, and the best of contemporary
        filmmaking, the programming here is unmatched in its depth and variety.
        Whether it&apos;s a rare 35mm print, a silent film with live
        accompaniment, or a preview with a Q&A, every visit offers something you
        won&apos;t find anywhere else.

        Beyond the screenings, BFI Southbank is home to the BFI National
        Archive&apos;s treasures, with Mediatheque offering free access to
        thousands of films and TV programmes from the collection. The venue also
        hosts major festivals including the BFI London Film Festival and BFI
        Flare, plus regular seasons exploring everything from forgotten genres
        to the complete works of cinema&apos;s greatest auteurs. It&apos;s a
        place where film is treated as an art form, and every screening is an
        opportunity to see something special.
