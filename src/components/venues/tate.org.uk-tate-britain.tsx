        Tate Britain is the national gallery of British art, located on Millbank
        in Pimlico, Central London. Housing a world-class collection spanning
        over five centuries of British art, from Tudor portraiture to
        contemporary installations, the gallery also hosts a programme of film
        screenings and moving-image events. These often explore themes connected
        to its exhibitions and collection, offering audiences a chance to
        experience cinema in the context of one of the UK&apos;s most important
        art institutions.
