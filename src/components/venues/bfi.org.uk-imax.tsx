        BFI IMAX boasts Britain&apos;s largest cinema screen—over 20 metres high
        and 26 metres wide—delivering an unparalleled immersive experience that
        puts you right inside the action. Originally built to showcase
        large-format IMAX documentaries, it now programmes a mix of Hollywood
        blockbusters, specially formatted releases, and true 70mm IMAX films
        that take full advantage of the enormous screen and crystal-clear image
        quality. When a film is shot or remastered for IMAX, this is where you
        want to see it.

        The venue&apos;s dual laser projection system and powerful surround
        sound make every screening a spectacle, whether it&apos;s the latest
        sci-fi epic, a nature documentary, or a classic film given the IMAX
        treatment. Located in the distinctive drum-shaped building at the heart
        of Waterloo&apos;s roundabout, BFI IMAX specializes in films that demand
        to be seen big—really big. If you&apos;re after pure cinematic scale and
        technical excellence, this is London&apos;s ultimate big-screen
        destination.
