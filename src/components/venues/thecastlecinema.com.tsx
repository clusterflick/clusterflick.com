        The Castle Cinema is a beloved independent cinema on Brooksby&apos;s
        Walk in Homerton, Hackney. Opened in 2018 in a beautifully converted
        former church hall, the single-screen cinema programmes a thoughtful mix
        of new releases, independent, arthouse, classic, and repertory films,
        alongside special events, Q&amp;A sessions, and community screenings.

        With its welcoming atmosphere, affordable prices, excellent bar, and
        strong ties to the local community, The Castle Cinema has quickly
        established itself as one of east London&apos;s favourite independent
        cinemas.
