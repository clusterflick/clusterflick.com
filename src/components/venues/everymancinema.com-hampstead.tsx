        Everyman Hampstead is the original Everyman cinema, the venue from which
        the entire chain grew. Tucked away on Holly Bush Vale in the heart of
        Hampstead village, north London, this historic single-screen cinema
        first opened in 1933 and has been a beloved local institution ever
        since. It was one of the first repertory cinemas in Britain, pioneering
        the idea of showing classic and arthouse films in an intimate,
        comfortable setting.

        Today, the cinema retains its characterful, independent spirit while
        offering the signature Everyman experience: sofa-style seating, food and
        drink served directly to your seat, and a curated programme of
        mainstream releases alongside independent and arthouse films. Like all
        Everyman venues, it offers a membership scheme for regular cinema-goers.
        Its village setting and rich history make it one of London&apos;s most
        charming places to watch a film.
