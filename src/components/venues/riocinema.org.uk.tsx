        The Rio Cinema is a much-loved independent cinema on Kingsland High
        Street in Dalston, East London. Originally opened in 1915 as the
        Kingsland Empire, the Grade II listed Art Deco building was saved from
        closure by a community campaign in the 1970s and has been run as a
        not-for-profit ever since. The single-screen cinema programmes a
        thoughtful mix of mainstream, independent, arthouse, world, and classic
        films, alongside special events, Q&amp;A screenings, and community
        programming.

        Known for its welcoming atmosphere, affordable ticket prices, and strong
        community ties, the Rio is a treasured fixture of Dalston&apos;s
        cultural life and one of London&apos;s finest independent cinemas.
