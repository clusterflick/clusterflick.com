        The Francis Crick Institute is a world-leading biomedical research
        centre on Midland Road, next to St Pancras International and the British
        Library in Central London. While primarily a scientific research
        facility, the Crick hosts public engagement events including occasional
        film screenings and science-themed cinema events as part of its
        programme to connect science with the wider community.
