        The Royal Albert Hall is one of the world&apos;s most famous concert
        venues, located on Kensington Gore in South Kensington, central London.
        Opened in 1871, the Grade I listed building hosts a vast programme of
        live music, from the BBC Proms to rock and pop concerts. Alongside its
        main programme, the Royal Albert Hall hosts a popular &quot;Films in
        Concert&quot; series, where classic and contemporary film scores are
        performed live by a full orchestra in sync with the film projected on a
        giant screen—an epic cinematic experience in one of London&apos;s most
        iconic settings.
