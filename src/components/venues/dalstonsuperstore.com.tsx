        Dalston Superstore is a bar, club, and cultural space on Kingsland High
        Street in Dalston, east London. A much-loved fixture of London&apos;s
        LGBTQ+ scene, it hosts a varied programme of club nights, live music,
        art exhibitions, and performance events across two floors. Alongside its
        main nightlife programme, Dalston Superstore occasionally hosts film
        screenings and cinema-related events, often with a queer focus.
