        Birkbeck Central is the main campus of Birkbeck, University of London on
        Malet Street in Bloomsbury. The university&apos;s lecture halls host
        film screenings organised by the Birkbeck Film Society, showcasing
        everything from classic cinema to contemporary arthouse and anime. With
        its evening-focused schedule (Birkbeck specialises in part-time evening
        study), film events attract a mix of students, academics, and film
        enthusiasts.
