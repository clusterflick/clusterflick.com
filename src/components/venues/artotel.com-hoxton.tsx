        art&apos;otel London Hoxton features a 60-seat screening room that hosts
        seasonal film screenings throughout the year as part of the hotel&apos;s
        arts and culture programme. The intimate cinema space, located on the
        lower ground floor, runs curated events like Film House—combining dinner
        at The Brush Grand Café with classic film screenings accompanied by
        themed cocktails and popcorn. The venue also partners with Bounce
        Cinema, a film club dedicated to showcasing emerging talent, bringing
        independent and short films to the screen alongside special event
        programming.

        Beyond public screenings, the cinema is available for private hire for
        screenings, presentations, and product launches, with the adjacent art
        gallery available for drinks receptions. With luxurious red reclining
        seats, modern projection and sound, and a focus on creating special
        cinema experiences rather than just showing films, it&apos;s a boutique
        screening venue that blends hospitality with film culture in the heart
        of Hoxton.
