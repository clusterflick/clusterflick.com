        Castlehaven Community Cinema is a volunteer-led community cinema at
        Clarence Hall in Camden that presents free monthly screenings of
        contemporary world cinema on the first Thursday of every month. Launched
        in 2024 from a shared love of film, the cinema showcases everything from
        Oscar-winning international films (Parasite) to critically acclaimed
        documentaries (Four Daughters), timeless classics, and independent
        features from the past 20 years. What started with a handful of
        attendees has grown into a thriving community of regulars united by
        their passion for cinema.

        The cinema partners with UFP Film Club to enhance screenings with Q&As,
        filmmaker discussions, and post-screening conversations that connect
        audiences with the stories and creators behind the films. Dedicated to
        tackling financial barriers to cinema access and fostering community
        inclusion, Castlehaven Community Cinema offers a welcoming space where
        people can experience quality world cinema without cost, supported by
        passionate volunteers who programme, facilitate, and promote each
        screening. For ages 18+, it&apos;s a true grassroots cinema experience
        celebrating independent and international storytelling.
