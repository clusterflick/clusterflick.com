        The Institute of Contemporary Arts (ICA) is a leading arts centre on The
        Mall in Central London, near Buckingham Palace. Founded in 1946, the ICA
        has been at the forefront of contemporary art, film, music, and cultural
        debate for decades. Its cinema programme is one of the most adventurous
        in London, showcasing experimental, avant-garde, documentary, and world
        cinema alongside artists&apos; film and video work, often programmed in
        dialogue with the gallery exhibitions upstairs.

        The ICA Cinema regularly hosts previews, premieres, filmmaker Q&amp;A
        events, and curated seasons. It is a key venue for film festivals and
        special events, and a vital platform for cinema that challenges and
        expands the boundaries of the medium.
