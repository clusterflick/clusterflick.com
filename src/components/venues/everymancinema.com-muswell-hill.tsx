        Everyman Muswell Hill is part of the Everyman cinema group, a boutique
        chain known for its intimate, living-room-style cinema experience.
        Located on Fortis Green Road in Muswell Hill, north London, the venue
        offers sofa-style seating, food and drink served directly to your seat,
        and a curated programme of mainstream releases alongside independent and
        arthouse films. The cinema also features a bar area for pre- and
        post-film drinks.
      </p>

        Like all Everyman venues, it offers a membership scheme for regular
        cinema-goers and a focus on quality over quantity, with smaller,
        carefully designed screening rooms that prioritise comfort and
        atmosphere. The venue serves Muswell Hill&apos;s strong local community
        in this popular residential area of north London.
