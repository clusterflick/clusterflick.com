        The Rivoli Ballroom is a Grade II listed ballroom on Brockley Road in
        Crofton Park, Southeast London. It is the last intact 1950s ballroom in
        London, with its original ornate interior of red velvet, gilt mirrors,
        and sprung dance floor still beautifully preserved. While primarily a
        venue for live music, dancing, and private events, the Rivoli
        occasionally hosts film screenings and cinema events in its atmospheric,
        one-of-a-kind setting.
