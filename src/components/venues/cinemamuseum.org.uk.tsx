        The Cinema Museum is a unique charitable museum in Kennington dedicated
        to preserving the history of cinema and the experience of cinema-going
        from the earliest days to the present. Housed in the former Lambeth
        Workhouse—where Charlie Chaplin lived as a child—the museum holds an
        extraordinary collection of film projectors of every gauge ever
        manufactured, vintage cinema memorabilia, posters, programmes, and
        equipment spanning over a century of film history. Founded in 1986 by
        Ronald Grant and Martin Humphries from their own private collection,
        it&apos;s a living archive where film enthusiasts can experience cinema
        history through guided tours and special events.

        Beyond its role as a museum, the venue hosts film screenings using
        specially adapted vintage projectors that show silent films at the
        correct gauge and speed, alongside modern film events and theatrical
        performances. The museum runs an eclectic programme of talks,
        screenings, and cultural events that celebrate all aspects of cinema,
        from early silent films to contemporary television culture. Open
        primarily by appointment for guided tours and special events, The Cinema
        Museum is a grassroots, volunteer-run space that offers a tangible,
        immersive connection to cinema&apos;s past—complete with the scent of
        old celluloid and the charm of a truly independent cultural institution.
