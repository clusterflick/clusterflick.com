        MOTH Club is a bar, music venue, and events space on Valette Street in
        Hackney, east London. Housed in a former ex-servicemen&apos;s club, the
        venue retains its characterful, retro interiors and hosts a programme of
        live music, DJ nights, comedy, and cultural events. Alongside its main
        nightlife programme, MOTH Club occasionally hosts film screenings and
        cinema events.
