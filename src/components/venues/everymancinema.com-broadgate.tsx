        Everyman Broadgate is part of the Everyman cinema group, a boutique
        chain known for its intimate, living-room-style cinema experience.
        Located on Finsbury Avenue in the Broadgate development in the City of
        London, near Liverpool Street station, the venue offers sofa-style
        seating, food and drink served directly to your seat, and a curated
        programme of mainstream releases alongside independent and arthouse
        films. The cinema also features a bar area for pre- and post-film
        drinks.

        Like all Everyman venues, it offers a membership scheme for regular
        cinema-goers and a focus on quality over quantity, with smaller,
        carefully designed screening rooms that prioritise comfort and
        atmosphere. Its location in the financial district makes it a popular
        option for after-work screenings.
