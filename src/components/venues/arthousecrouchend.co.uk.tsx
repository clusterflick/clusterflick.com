        ArtHouse Crouch End is a truly independent two-screen cinema and live
        performance space created by local people and housed in a striking brick
        church building on Tottenham Lane. The venue programmes a mix of
        independent, arthouse, and crossover films alongside screenings of short
        works by London filmmakers, many making their debut here. With its retro
        aesthetic, affordable ticket prices (including discounted rates for
        over-60s and 15-25s), and community-driven ethos, it&apos;s the absolute
        antithesis of a chain multiplex.

        Beyond film, ArtHouse hosts live theatre, music events, and runs regular
        clubs including Babes in Arms screenings for parents with babies,
        sensory impaired screenings with audio description and subtitles, and an
        annual short film showcase spotlighting local talent. The in-house
        vegetarian café serves food from local suppliers, and the whole
        space—complete with a giant silvery wire angel at the entrance—feels
        like a neighbourhood cultural hub where film is just one part of a
        broader creative mission.
