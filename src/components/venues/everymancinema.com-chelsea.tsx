        Everyman Chelsea is part of the Everyman cinema group, a boutique chain
        known for its intimate, living-room-style cinema experience. Located on
        the King&apos;s Road in Chelsea, southwest London, the venue offers
        sofa-style seating, food and drink served directly to your seat, and a
        curated programme of mainstream releases alongside independent and
        arthouse films. The cinema also features a stylish bar area for pre- and
        post-film drinks.

        Like all Everyman venues, it offers a membership scheme for regular
        cinema-goers and a focus on quality over quantity, with smaller,
        carefully designed screening rooms that prioritise comfort and
        atmosphere.
