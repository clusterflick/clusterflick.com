        The Frontline Club is an independent members&apos; club and media hub on
        Norfolk Place near Paddington, west London. Founded in 2003, it serves
        as a meeting point for journalists, filmmakers, and photographers, with
        a focus on press freedom and conflict reporting. The club hosts a
        regular programme of documentary and journalism-related film screenings,
        Q&amp;A events, panel discussions, and talks, alongside a restaurant and
        bar. Its screenings often feature documentaries on global affairs, human
        rights, and current events, frequently followed by discussions with the
        filmmakers.
