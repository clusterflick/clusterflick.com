        Everyman Stratford International is part of the Everyman cinema group, a
        boutique chain known for its intimate, living-room-style cinema
        experience. Located on Redman Place near the Queen Elizabeth Olympic
        Park in Stratford, East London, the venue offers sofa-style seating,
        food and drink served directly to your seat, and a curated programme of
        mainstream releases alongside independent and arthouse films. The cinema
        also features a bar area for pre- and post-film drinks.
      </p>

        Like all Everyman venues, it offers a membership scheme for regular
        cinema-goers and a focus on quality over quantity, with smaller,
        carefully designed screening rooms that prioritise comfort and
        atmosphere.
