        Everyman Screen on the Green is a historic single-screen cinema on Upper
        Street in Islington, north London. Originally opened in 1913, it is one
        of the oldest continuously operating cinemas in the UK and has a storied
        cultural history—it famously hosted early punk gigs in the 1970s,
        including performances by the Sex Pistols, The Clash, and the Buzzcocks.
        Now part of the Everyman cinema group, the venue has been refurbished
        with the chain&apos;s signature sofa-style seating, food and drink
        served to your seat, and a bar area.

        Despite its boutique makeover, Screen on the Green retains its
        distinctive character as a beloved Islington landmark. The programme
        combines mainstream releases with independent and arthouse films. Like
        all Everyman venues, it offers a membership scheme for regular
        cinema-goers.
