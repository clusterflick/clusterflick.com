        Tate Modern is one of the world&apos;s leading galleries of modern and
        contemporary art, housed in the former Bankside Power Station on the
        South Bank of the Thames. The gallery has a strong commitment to
        moving-image art and regularly programmes film screenings, artists&apos;
        film and video works, and cinema events. Its film programme often
        features experimental, avant-garde, and artist-led work, alongside
        screenings connected to its major exhibitions.
