        Curzon Mayfair is the flagship venue of the Curzon cinema group, a
        celebrated chain of independent cinemas known for championing arthouse,
        independent, and world cinema alongside quality mainstream releases.
        Located at 38 Curzon Street in Mayfair—the street from which the brand
        takes its name—this historic cinema first opened its doors in 1934 and
        has been a cornerstone of London&apos;s independent film scene ever
        since. The venue features elegantly appointed screening rooms, including
        a large main auditorium, along with a bar and lounge area.

        As Curzon&apos;s original and most storied location, the Mayfair cinema
        is a regular host for premieres, previews, and filmmaker Q&amp;A events.
        It offers the Curzon membership scheme and access to Curzon Home Cinema,
        the chain&apos;s on-demand streaming platform. Its programme showcases
        the best of independent, foreign-language, and documentary cinema
        alongside selected wider releases, maintaining a legacy of nearly a
        century of quality film exhibition in the West End.
