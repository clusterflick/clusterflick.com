        The Barbican is one of London&apos;s leading arthouse cinemas, with
        three screens (Cinema 1 in the main Brutalist centre and Cinemas 2 & 3
        across the road on Beech Street) showcasing an exceptionally curated
        programme of international cinema, new releases, restored classics, and
        experimental film. Programming spans everything from contemporary
        arthouse and world cinema to rare archive prints and comprehensive
        director retrospectives, with a strong emphasis on lesser-seen gems and
        under-heard voices from past and present. The venue is particularly
        renowned for its ScreenTalks—post-screening Q&As with directors, actors,
        and filmmakers that bring audiences closer to the creative process.

        Beyond its core film offering, the Barbican hosts major film festivals
        and seasons (including Experiments in Film, themed retrospectives, and
        international cinema showcases like the Iranian New Wave series),
        alongside silent films with live musical accompaniment and event cinema
        broadcasts of theatre and opera. The cinema is exceptionally accessible,
        with relaxed screenings for neurodiverse audiences, parent and baby
        screenings, senior community screenings, audio description, and
        captioned performances. With Pay What You Can screenings and a welcoming
        café-bar that operates all day on Beech Street, it&apos;s a cinema that
        combines artistic ambition with genuine community spirit.
