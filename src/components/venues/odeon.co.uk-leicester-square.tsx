        ODEON Luxe Leicester Square is the flagship venue of the ODEON cinema
        chain, one of the UK&apos;s oldest and largest cinema operators.
        Situated at 24-26 Leicester Square in the heart of London&apos;s West
        End, this iconic cinema first opened in 1937 and has been one of the
        most famous film premiere venues in the world ever since. As an ODEON
        Luxe venue, it features recliner seating, enhanced comfort, and premium
        screen and sound technology. Its grand main auditorium has hosted
        countless red-carpet premieres for major Hollywood and British films.

        The cinema underwent a major refurbishment and reopened with the Luxe
        branding, combining its historic prestige with a thoroughly modern
        cinema-going experience. Its prime position on Leicester Square—the
        traditional home of London&apos;s film premieres—makes it one of the
        most recognisable cinemas in the country.
