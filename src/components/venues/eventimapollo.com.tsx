        The Eventim Apollo is a landmark concert and entertainment venue on
        Queen Caroline Street in Hammersmith, west London. Originally opened in
        1932 as the Gaumont Palace cinema, the Art Deco building went on to
        become one of London&apos;s most famous live music venues—known over the
        years as the Hammersmith Odeon, the Carling Apollo, and the HMV
        Hammersmith Apollo. While primarily a live music and events venue today,
        the Apollo occasionally hosts film screenings and cinema events, taking
        advantage of its grand auditorium and large screen.
