        The Foundry is an award-winning eco workspace and events centre in
        Vauxhall that hosts film screenings as part of its commitment to social
        justice and community engagement. Housed in a beautifully converted
        former shoe-polish factory, this venue serves primarily as a base for
        social impact organisations working on human rights and social justice
        causes, but its meeting rooms and presentation spaces double as
        screening venues for documentaries, activist cinema, and socially
        engaged films that align with its mission.
