        The Freud Museum London is located at 20 Maresfield Gardens in
        Hampstead, north London—the final home of Sigmund Freud after he fled
        Nazi-annexed Vienna in 1938. The museum preserves Freud&apos;s study,
        including his famous psychoanalytic couch, library, and collection of
        antiquities. Alongside its permanent exhibition, the museum hosts a
        programme of cultural events including occasional film screenings,
        typically exploring themes related to psychoanalysis, the mind, and
        cinema&apos;s relationship with the unconscious.
