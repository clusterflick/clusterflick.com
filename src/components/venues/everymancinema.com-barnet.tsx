        Everyman Barnet is part of the Everyman cinema group, a boutique chain
        known for its intimate, living-room-style cinema experience. Located on
        Great North Road in Barnet, north London, the venue offers sofa-style
        seating, food and drink served directly to your seat, and a curated
        programme of mainstream releases alongside independent and arthouse
        films. The cinema also features a bar area for pre- and post-film
        drinks.

        Like all Everyman venues, it offers a membership scheme for regular
        cinema-goers and a focus on quality over quantity, with smaller,
        carefully designed screening rooms that prioritise comfort and
        atmosphere.
